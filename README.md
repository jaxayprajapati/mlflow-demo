# MLflow Demo with ElasticNet and Wine Quality Dataset

This repository contains a demonstration of using MLflow to train, log, and manage machine learning models with the ElasticNet algorithm using the Wine Quality dataset. MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Git (for version control)
- to install requirements.txt use following command
- pip install -r requirements.txt 


## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

mlflow-demo
- `data/`: Data folder
  - `wine-quality.csv`: Wine Quality dataset

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks (optional)
  - `mlflow_demo.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for the MLflow demo

- `src/`: Source code folder
  - `train.py`: Python script to train the ElasticNet model
